- Author: Jimmy Kolev
- Version: 1.1.0
- Trading Update (Users can trade between themselves by offering gold for cards!)
- Selling overhaul, sell items for market value and cards based on rarity
## Description
Myth-Bot is a trading card game bot for Discord. It is built in Discord.js and uses MongoDB for data storage. It is currently in development and is not yet ready for use. To keep up to date with the development of Myth-Bot, look at the GitHub repository.

Myth Bot acts as a trading card system for gods & creatures from different mythologies.
Each trading card has unqiue values for each attribute, those attributes being;
Attack, Defence, Speed, Range, Ability Points and Rarity. Each value is carefully
selected and decided by reviewing each creature/god's abilities. The end goal of Myth Bot
is to be able to have card battles between users. However, currently I am aiming to make the bot
work in a TopTrumps style, where the users pick which attribute they want to use and the user who's 
card's attribute has the highest value wins, users battle for gold.

For the current version's capabilities see the Current Version section.

## Current Features
### Currently Users can:
- Use /getstarted to get added to the database.
- Use /getcard to get a random card or gold if they already have the card.
- Use /balance to check their balance.
- Use /viewcards to view their cards.
- Use /sell to get a card or item for gold.
- Use /battle to battle against the bot.
- Use /shop to buy artifacts
- Use /inventory to view your artifacts
- Use /profile to view your profile or another user's profile
- Use /profilecolour to personalize the colour of profile
- Use /offergold to send another user a trade offer with coins
- Use /requests to toggle your trade requests on/off
- Use /stats to see the stats of specific cards

## Planned Features
### Planned Features for Users:
- Money making commands like blackjack and coin flip
- Battling another user
- Trading Cards for Cards and Items for Items

## Purpose
The reason I started working on this bot is to revive an old project I didn't have the capabilities to create at the time, the repo still exists on my github, The Chelsea Bot. I wanted to create a trading card game bot as a passion project, nothing too complex here but just something I wanted to create for a while. Additionally with some simple Node.js, JavaScript and Discord.js knowledge, anyone can change the code and create their own similar bot with any topic. This bot provides the commands needed for a system to exist.
