# Myth-Bot
- A trading card game bot for Discord built in Discord.js 
- Author: Jimmy Kolev
- Version: 1.0.0
## Description
Myth-Bot is a trading card game bot for Discord. It is built in Discord.js and uses MongoDB for data storage. It is currently in development and is not yet ready for use. To keep up to date with the development of Myth-Bot, look at the GitHub repository.

Myth Bot acts as a trading card system for gods & creatures from different mythologies.
Each trading card has unqiue values for each attribute, those attributes being;
Attack, Defence, Speed, Range, Ability Points and Rarity. Each value is carefully
selected and decided by reviewing each creature/god's abilities. The end goal of Myth Bot
is to be able to have card battles between users. However, currently I am aiming to make the bot
work in a TopTrumps style, where the users pick which attribute they want to use and the user who's 
card's attribute has the highest value wins, users battle for gold.

For the current version's capabilities see the Current Version section.

## Current Features
### Currently Users can:
- Use /getstarted to get added to the database.

- Use /balance to check their balance.
- Use /viewcards to view their cards.

- Use /battle to battle against the bot.

## Planned Features
### Planned Features for Users:
- Money making commands like blackjack and coin flip
